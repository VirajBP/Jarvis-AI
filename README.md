Project Description: Building Jarvis - A Voice-Controlled Assistant 🎙️🤖

Excited to showcase my latest project, Jarvis, a voice-controlled assistant developed using Python. Jarvis integrates speech recognition, text-to-speech capabilities, and APIs to perform various tasks efficiently.

Key Features:
1. Voice Recognition: Utilizes the speech_recognition library to accurately capture voice commands.
2. Text-to-Speech: Employs pyttsx3 for responsive speech output, enhancing user interaction.
3. API Integration: Integrates with Google Calendar API to manage events 📅 and NewsAPI to fetch real-time news updates 📰.
4. Weather Information: Provides current weather updates for any city using OpenWeatherMap API ☀️.
5. Dynamic Command Processing: Processes commands like opening websites 🌐, playing music 🎵, and managing calendar events.
6. User Interaction: Designed for seamless interaction through spoken commands, making it convenient and accessible.

Technologies Used: Python 🐍, speech_recognition 🗣️, pyttsx3 🔊, Google APIs (Calendar, OAuth) 📝, NewsAPI 📰, OpenWeatherMap API ☀️.

This project has strengthened my skills in Python programming, API integration, and problem-solving through real-world applications. Moving forward, I aim to enhance Jarvis with more functionalities and explore advanced AI capabilities to enrich user experiences.
